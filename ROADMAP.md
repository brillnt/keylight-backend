## Phase 4: Project Milestone Tracking
**Goal:** Track project phases and milestones through ClickUp integration

### 4.1 Project Phase Management
- [ ] Define standard project phases (Design, Permits, Construction, etc.)
- [ ] Create ClickUp subtasks for each project phase
- [ ] Track phase completion and dependencies
- [ ] Milestone date tracking and notifications

### 4.2 Timeline Management
